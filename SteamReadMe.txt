This is for the opt in 0.9.1 beta and does not work for the current release.  Use the version fo the mod without the beta suffix.

On the after raid screen, prevents the vest quick slots at the bottom of the screen from being unloaded.

Click the unload button while holding shift to use the normal unload which unloads the vest slots.
